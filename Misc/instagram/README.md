I need a hacker please!!! My photo was going to get thousands of likes, but it was corrupted ðŸ˜©. <photo.png>

## Setup

Just need to replace the link in the description to an actualy download link of `photo.png`. NOTE: make sure
we upload `photo.png`, and NOT `photo.jpg`.

## Brief Dev Description

A handwritten flag that needs to be opened as a jpg instead of png.

## Solution

All one needs to do is change the extension to .jpg and add back the "JFIF" header.
Diff `photo.jpg` and `photo.png` to see the solution.
