# Geography

My friend told me that she found something cool on the Internet, but all she sent me was 11000010100011000111111111101110 and 11000001100101000011101111011111.

She's always been a bit cryptic. She told me to "surround with gigem{} that which can be seen from a bird's eye view"... what?

## Setup

Just needs the description!

## Brief Dev Description

Introduces users to floating point representation, and forces them to think outside the box.

## Solution

1. Convert binary to IEEE 754 floating point numbers.
2. Swap the order.
3. Find a coca-colo logo at these coordinates in Chile on Google Maps. Flag is gigem{coca-cola}.
