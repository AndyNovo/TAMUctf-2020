Apparently my packages are out of date. ITSEC is really throwing a fit about me
needing to update since red team popped my box.

I'm sending them my installed packages. I have no idea how these guys got root
on my machine, my password is like 60 characters long. The only thing I have
as nopasswd is apt, which I just use for updates anyway.
