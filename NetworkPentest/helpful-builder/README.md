# Helpful Builder

```text
I know you can't build on your machine -- it's so dumb that IT won't install JDK12 for one of our developers.

Go ahead and fire over a tarfile with the contents of src/main in it on our typical netcat port, I'll compile the test jar so you can run it on your side.
I'll make my sources available on http://172.17.0.2:8000 so you can fetch the test jar.
```

## Setup

1. `docker build -t helpful-builder .`
2. `docker run --rm -d helpful-builder`

## Brief Dev Description

Netcat session which is reading from the stream in, untarring it into the src/main directory, then sending back the generated test jar.

There are a few ways to solve this problem, but they all come down to compile time execution. The solution provided is one of the simpler ways to do this.

## Solution

This particular solution used exploits annotations processors to spawn a reverse shell via the @Test annotation used by the testing classes.
