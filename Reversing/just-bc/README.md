# Just BC

A blind reversing of an uncommon bitcode from top to bottom. Have fun!

## Description

```
We found this reference file for a program contained by a remote server, but we have no idea what it is.
All we know is that whenever we connect there's a password prompt. Can you figure out what that password is?

The live instance is at 172.17.0.2:4932.
```

Contestants will be provided with just-bc.bin, generated by `./build.sh`.
If you don't have rust installed, just ask Addison for a copy!

## Running

1. `docker build -t just-bc .`
2. `docker run --rm --read-only just-bc`

## Solution

1. Determine that the file is an LLVM-BC file.
2. Compile it to assembly with `llc`
3. `cat just_bc.s | grep "ascii" | grep -B 3 -A 3 "Password"`
4. `nc 172.17.0.2 4932`
5. `lmaoniceonebuddypalfriendolino`
